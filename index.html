                This logo signifys our pride in our works. Each product has one of our symbols hand carved into it as a proof of authentification
                and a badge to show the amount of work gone into it. Our woodworker handles everything we sell, and has put his time and effort into
                their creation. No two products are the same, each as perfectly unique as the wood that was used to create it.
            </p>

                Anthony Woodworking Co. is a new, local business in the Springfield, MO Area. Housed out of Fair Grove, we are a small, but prideful
                company. The company travels around selling the products, not every staying at a perminate venue so that we can reach more people. However,
                we do have an online shop. If you are interested in buying a product online, perhaps if you can't ever seem to meet up with us or are too far
                to make the drive, feel free to visit our Etsy Shop! Just recently created, it allows you to shop AWC anywhere!
            </p>
